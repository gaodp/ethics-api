# Contributing to ethics-api

We're thrilled you want to contribute to ethics-api. Here are the rules of the road for doing so:

## Code style

* Indentation is two spaces.
* Comments should only be provided for cases where the code is doing something that the average
  bear might not ascertain from reading the code.
* Avoid single letter variable names unless they're only used within the same line. Even then,
  you may be asked to change them.
* Try to keep line at or shorter than 100 characters wide.
* If you touch a file you may be asked to help clean it up even if you didn't commit the original
  mistakes.

## Process

The process for working on things in the ethics-api is pretty straightforward. The project
maintainers and people who have concerns or ideas for the API will create
[issues](https://github.com/gaodp/ethics-api/issues). To work on those issues you should:

1. Create a branch for your work. If you have write access to the ethics-api repository, then
  you should create a branch on ethics-api. If you don't, then you'll need to fork ethics-api to
  your GitHub account first. Even if you are working in your own fork **your work should be done
  in a branch other than master.** If you don't do this you will run into issues down the road.

  * [How to fork and keep a fork in sync](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. Make changes to the code / tests.
3. Push your code to your branch/fork.
4. Create a pull request. In the pull request description mention that it closes a particular
  issue number if it does.

  * [Closing issues via pull request](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests)
5. One of the project maintainers will then review your code and will probably suggest changes.
  Please be curteous and remember that the changes that the suggestions that are made are done
  for the betterment of the entire project. We all have something to learn from another person
  looking at our code.
6. Once the reviewer is confident that the work is done correctly and that it is ready to be used,
  they will merge it.
